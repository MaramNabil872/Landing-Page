                        As we've said, we do this because we truly care about
                        the planet and about seeing people embrace a greener,
                        more eco-friendly approach to power. The world of green
                        energy can be jargon-filled and opaque, so we want to
                        help educate people on the big and little things they
                        can do to protect our planet!
